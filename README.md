# CommUnity

## Overview:
Community is a crowd-powered mobile application designed to allow users to report and access real-time, local information. This app aims to combine safety, convenience, and community engagement, enabling users to collaborate on solving everyday problems and stay informed about their local community. With features like reporting lost items, sharing local recommendations, and raising alerts about emergencies, Community will serve as a centralized, real-time hub that helps address the need for local information. The app will be developed using React Native for cross-platform mobile development, with a backend powered by Django or Node.js and PostgreSQL for database management. Real-time communication will be enabled through WebSockets or Firebase, and the app will leverage Google Maps API or Mapbox for geolocation features, all hosted on AWS or Google Cloud for scalability.
